# warlock-custom-trait
Warlock Custom Class feature - "Great Old One"

How this Character Trait works:

* Each day, roll d100
    * 0 - 95: No obsession
    * 96 - 100: You are obsessed with something on this chart
        * Roll 1d6 to determine how many days you are obsessed
        * Roll d100 and pick an item from this chart
* Chart effects that have a saving throw listed:
    * Roll saving throw as described to gain a positive outcome. "Positive" is determined by common sense, or, failing that, by the DM
    * Each day that the obsession would still be in effect, the saving throw must be re-rolled
* At the end of 1d6 days **plus** a long rest, the obsession is gone
    * e.g. if you roll 1: After one day, take a long rest, the obsession is gone
